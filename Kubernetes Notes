1. To query all the nodes in the cluster

# kubectl get nodes

2. To see more details about the nodes:

# kubectl get nodes -o wide

3. To check pods in the cluster

# kubectl get pods

In kubernetes we create manifest files or kubernetes object defintion files

These files are written in YAML and every YAML will have an ectesions as .yml or .yaml

Any code written in YAML will be in the format of :

key: value

For example, the YAML code is written like this:


company: edureka
course: devops
trainer: sonal mittal
time: 7 am
day: weekday

In YAMl how to give list of values

company: edureka
courses:
 - devops
 - aws
 - gcp
 - DOL
 - Azure
trainer:
 - sonal
 - Ravi
 - Ajay
 - Sam
 - Linda
time:
 - 7AM
 - 8.30PM
days:
 - weekdays
 - weekends 

In YAML how to create an array of object


trainer:
 - name: Sonal
   email: sonal@gmail.com
   phone: 76788
 - name: Ravi
   email: ravi@gmail.com
   phone: 242453
   
   
Best way to create an object in kubernetes is to use Manifest files

These files are written in YAML

Object: POD, ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service

Sections that are written inside a manifest file on any object in Kubernetes

apiVersion: schema
kind: the name of object that you want to create
metadata:
Provide details of the object like : name, labels

Labels: 
They are used to tag the pods with a unique label
This label will be used for grouping pods & querying pods in the cluster

spec:
Here you will specify what is it that you want on the object

Object Definition file for a POD with single container:
********************

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: mypod
 labels:
  author: sonal
  app: mynginx
spec:
 containers:
  - name: c1
    image: nginx


create the object in kube

$ kubectl create -f pod-defintion.yml
